# MovieBook


The aim of this project is to build a movie based social network -- MovieBook -- for movie fans. MovieBook has following features:

Movie Information : MovieBook provides detailed movie information, including directors, actors, duration, reviews, and ratings. Especially, MovieBook combines ratings from IMDB, Fandango, RottenTomatoes, and Metacritic, so that ratings on these four world’s most popular movie sites can be easily obtained from MovieBook, instead of searching on each site.

Social Community : MovieBook enables users to easily evaluate movies by writing reviews. Besides, users on MovieBook can also interact with other users by the “Following” button. On one user’s profile page, public personal information, movies that this user liked, scores that this user rated, and reviews that this user wrote are summarized, so that users can find friends having the same taste.

Personalized Recommendation System : MovieBook will recommend similar movies that one user has not watched based on movies that this user watched and liked.
